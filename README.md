## What's accessible-app.com?

In lack of a better comparison: A project like todomvc.com, but for web accessibility and and a showcase on how to solve accessibility problems in different Javascript frameworks.

I'm aiming to build this project in the open and blog about it:

* [Very first steps](https://marcus.io/blog/a11y-app-very-first-steps)
* [Further steps togehter](https://marcus.io/blog/a11y-app-further-steps-together)
* [A specific app idea](https://marcus.io/blog/a11y-app-specific-app-idea)
